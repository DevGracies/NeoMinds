              Neominds began as a calling ‚Äî a deep desire to ensure no child
              grows up feeling unseen, unheard, or unloved. Our founder‚Äôs own
              childhood experience taught her the importance of being
              intentional with young minds. Today, Neominds exists to create
              joyful, meaningful, and empowering experiences for every child.
